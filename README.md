# iOS Lightning Course / Training
This is a sneak peak into the lighning course to be held at the Technical University of Eindhoven in June / July 2020.  
Due to the outbreak of the corona virus and the great demand for online course materials I will publish some of the materials online.  
As of current I assume that the government will have the situation under control in July so the training will proceed unless adviced other wise by the government.
